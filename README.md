# Introduction to R 

These materials were developed for R workshop for psychology researchers to improve  project organization, workflow, and reproducibility. The lessons are geared towards new R users with little-to-no prior coding experience, and no formal coursework in data science or programming.

My hope is that students will walk away from this tutorial convinced that using R in their research projects will make their lives easier, not harder.

So, instead of starting with programming basics like operators, vectors, and logical statements, we will start with setting up R projects and R markdown notebooks before doing any real "coding". Then students will learn principles of tidying data, modeling, and visualizing data with R. 

## Lessons 
### Getting Started
- Intro slides: Why R? 
- Lesson 1: The 3 Rs (R studio, R Markdown & R Projects)
- Lesson 2: Dataframe Basics in R 

### Tidying data 
- Lesson 3: Summarizing data 
- Lesson 4: Manipulating data 

### Analyzing data
- Lesson 5: Basic statistics and models in R*
- Lesson 6: Visualizing data with ggplot*

## Data
Two sample (fake) datasets are used in this tutorial: 
- demo_data.csv 
- cort_data_wide.csv 

## Challenges 
These are coding challenges to accompany Lessons 3-6. 
Answer keys are also posted.
