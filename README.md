# Introduction to R 

### About  
These materials were developed for R workshop for psychology researchers to improve  project organization, workflow, and reproducibility. The lessons are geared towards new R users with little-to-no prior coding experience, and no formal coursework in data science or programming.

My hope is that students will walk away from this tutorial convinced that using R in their research projects will make their lives easier, not harder.

So, instead of starting with programming basics like operators, vectors, and logical statements, we will start with setting up R projects and R markdown notebooks before doing any real "coding". Then students will learn principles of tidying data, modeling, and visualizing data with R.

### Analyzing data
- Lesson 5: Basic statistics and models in R 
- Lesson 6: Visualizing data with ggplot
