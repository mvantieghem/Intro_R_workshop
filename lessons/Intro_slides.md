Why R? 
========================================================

- Research is iterative!
- Projects are completed over extended time periods.
- Think of yourself, 6 months, or years from now.

Let's improve project organization, workflow, and reproducibility. 

R for Reproducibility 
========================================================
**Project organization** 
- Raw data 
- Clean data 
- Scripts
- Tables
- Figures 

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use **R projects** to organize our code.


R for Reproducibility 
========================================================

**Data Cleaning** 
- Data is messy! 
- Programming can automate repeated processes and reduce human error.
- Scripts allow you to document and revise data-cleaning steps.

In this tutorial, we're going to learn how to make data "tidy", using **tidyverse packages**

R for Reproducibility 
========================================================

**Data Analysis**
- Reproduce the analysis with new data, or new methods.
- Create visualizations to share results 
- Generate reports to organize & share results. 

In this tutorial, we will make reports with **R markdown** and figures with **ggplot**.
